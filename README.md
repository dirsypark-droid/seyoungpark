# üìö Tech Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio.

I create documentation that helps users understand, trust, and enjoy technology.
In this portfolio, you‚Äôll find samples that illustrate how I approach complex technical topics‚Äîfrom API references to UX microcopy‚Äîwith precision and empathy for the reader.
My goal as a technical writer is to bridge the gap between product and user, ensuring that every piece of documentation contributes to a seamless experience.
